# Graph NN with Autograd for chemical systems

## Important To Do

MORE IMPROTANT:
- [ ] Refactor into Jax to include JIT, GPU and Sharding before adding to native support w/out

- [ ] Make dataset prearation
- [ ] Make dataset relevant to PaiNN
- [ ] After completion make for NAD
- [ ] complete update block
- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Recode Module to make compatible with message and update blocks
- [ ] Add optional if grad required statements for optimal computation
- [ ] Combine Linear and Linear3D evenrually

## Eventually will do the (RoadMap) Not in order

- [ ] Swfit support for metal gpu
- [ ] compiling functionality
- [ ] sharding
- [ ] Turn message passing into module
- [ ] Increase aggregation functionality
- [ ] In autograd add tensor indexing to get to work with message passing
- [ ] In autograd add a scatter operation (optimised)
- [ ] Add mathematics in here
- [ ] reference both papers for PaiNN and SchNet
- [ ] Add correct typing for each class/function
- [ ] Add compatibility to float and tensor operations
